# Project Title
### Data Engineering Capstone Project

#### Project Summary
### ***The project aims to take data relating to immigration, and perform ETL such that the data can be further analysed. The process will use airflow, and spark to co-ordinate the retrieval of the data, and transformation into fact and dimension tables. These will be stored in amazon redshift so that the users(data scientists) can query the data efficiently and perform the analytics. To accomplish the purpose of this project first perform  extracting and transforming the data using Apache Spark and loading the data to Amazon S3. then loading the star schema from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift using Apache Airflow, and performing data quality check*** ###



The project follows the follow steps:
* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
